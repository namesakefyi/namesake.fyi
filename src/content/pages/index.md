**Changing your legal name and gender is difficult.** From court paperwork to ID cards, social security, bank accounts, and dozens of other places—it’s a lot to manage.

We've been through this process and **we want it to be easier**. We’re building Namesake to help you fill out forms, track status, access financial support, and receive community guidance. You don’t have to do this alone.

The new Namesake app will launch in Massachusetts later this summer, with other states to follow. [Join us on Discord](/chat) for early access.

Rigid systems weren't built for us, but we’ll figure them out together.
