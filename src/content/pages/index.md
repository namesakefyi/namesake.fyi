**It's tough to change your legal name and gender.** There's loads of paperwork. You have to dig up your birth certificate, find a notary, show up at a courthouse, and pay filing fees… and that's just the first step. Then comes updating your ID, social security, banks, schools, and a hundred other things.

**We think it can be easier.** We're a trans-led team with years of experience running name change clinics. We're building a digital platform for clear, step-by-step guidance and community support, for free.

**The new Namesake app will launch in Massachusetts later this summer, with other states to follow.** [Join us on Discord](/chat) to get early access.

Rigid systems weren't built for us, but we’ll figure them out together.
