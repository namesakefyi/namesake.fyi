title: Your name is yours to change
---

**Changing your legal name and gender marker can feel daunting.** How long will the process take? How much will it cost? Do I need to find a notary (and if so, where)? Is the court system kind to trans people? Will I need to publish my name change in a newspaper?

It can all feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.

We're trans, and after going through this process ourselves, we built Namesake to make it easier for others. Namesake helps you fill out forms, track your progress, access financial resources, and receive community support. It's free, [open source](https://github.com/namesakefyi), and always will be.

Rigid systems weren't built for us, but weâ€™ll figure them out together.
