title: Your name is yours to change

**Changing your legal name and gender marker is tough.** There's paperwork, bureaucracy, and dozens of tasks to keep track of. Finding a notary. Paying fees. Judges and systems with uncertain hostility toward trans people.

It can all feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.

We're trans, and we've been through the process ourselves. We built Namesake to help you answer questions, fill out forms, track progress, access financial resources, and receive community support. **You don’t have to do this alone.**

Rigid systems weren't built for us, but we’ll figure them out together.
