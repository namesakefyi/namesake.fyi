## How it started

I started Namesake in 2021 after exchanging various rants with MTPC’s inimitable Kelsey Grunstra about the name and gender marker change process. After hearing even more folks’ stories, it quickly became clear that we weren’t the only ones struggling through it.

At the time, I was leading marketing and events at MassChallenge Fintech and had recently “come out” as trans. In fact, part of the impetus for my legal name change was born out of the strict ID requirements at finance buildings. At a time when my sense of self was simultaneously the strongest it has ever been and the most precarious, I wanted to avoid the involuntary and often demeaning outing required to be admitted into events (many that I had organized). 

At MassChallenge, I witnessed startups build and scale innovative solutions that brought automation, digitization, and personalization to highly regulated and complex legacy finance systems. I saw enormous potential in applying my learnings to streamline the legal name change process.

However, at the same time, I was already weary of big tech’s negligence in overlooking the experience (and safety) of its trans users. As I floated this idea to folks in the startup sector, immediately questions prioritizing market size and profit eroded my confidence. Was this really a big enough problem? How many trans people were there in the US, really? This both enraged and motivated me. I wanted us to be taken seriously. To be seen as human. To actually be considered in tech’s products and services—not just its marketing.

Then, in 2020 I tried to get a car loan, only to discover that I was credit invisible/credit thin due to my name change. This was the last straw. I was probably the most financially literate I had ever been, my credit score was solid—in essence, I thought I had done everything “right”—and still my future felt out of my hands. 

After all, I had never cared about how the government labeled or recognized me; I just wanted to live my life safely and with autonomy. The experience underscored just how far-reaching the implications of a name change could be, and how digitization presented an opportunity to address the systemic oppression embedded in legacy systems. 

So, in 2021 I took a chance and started building Namesake part-time. I moved quickly and learned a lot (maybe something for another time).

## How it's going

Since Namesake's start, we’ve supported 1000+ youth and adults in Massachusetts through our catalytic partnership with the Massachusetts Trans Political Coalition (thank you, MTPC!). We’ve co-led nearly 100 statewide name change clinics and trainings, and we’ve helped connect folks to over $45,000 in financial assistance. We’ve advocated for more equitable policy and processes, and we’ve fostered information sharing across the country through partnerships and collaboration. We’ve raised funds to keep it going. We even launched a [Discord](/chat) last year to facilitate more mutual aid and support. I’m proud of what we’ve built, and endlessly grateful for all of the people who have contributed to and rooted for Namesake.

That being said, a lot has happened in the world since we first started, and to put it bluntly, it’s terrifying. There are the certainties: the politicization of trans identities and its real-life impact on real-life humans, the bigotry, the danger. And there are the uncertainties, too—what will happen when I try to renew my license or passport? Will I be detained at an airport? Will I be able to access my hormones in the future? Will my marriage be recognized? The list goes on, in every direction, intersecting with all of the other horrors in our current world. I hope you’re also aware, enraged, and [taking action](https://secure.everyaction.com/P2P/j5xaSW4gmU6FZu4D3ELZbQ2/qX69jknqEfCPfGBFvdy_DQ2).

## Where it's headed

To that end, it’s more important than ever that we not only continue Namesake, but grow it to help people beyond Massachusetts. Over the past year, co-founder Eva Decker and I, along with the help and support of many others, have been preparing Namesake for this next iteration--now with even more urgency. We need Namesake 2.0, and its very existence has given me hope through these darker days. 

Early last year I began seriously reflecting on my future with Namesake. I wanted to ensure that its potential was not limited by my personal skill-set, needs, and responsibilities--so this fall, I decided to step back from running its day-to-day operations. As you can imagine, this is not a decision I’ve made lightly, especially at this critical time. I’ve poured so much of myself into Namesake, but I feel that I am not the person to take it to the next level, especially as my partner and I embark on a new journey in Oregon (their home state) this fall. 

While I will continue to support from afar, Eva has slowly taken the lead at Namesake, and I’m so grateful for her empathy, creativity, and resistance. They are not only a talented and brilliant designer and engineer, but more importantly a truly amazing person. I’m so excited about her vision for Namesake’s future. She will (re)introduce herself (and the new Namesake app) properly soon! In the meantime, if you want to support Namesake, reach out at [eva@namesake.fyi](mailto:eva@namesake.fyi).

## Thank you for everything

I’ve learned so much through building Namesake--about myself, about transness, about listening with compassion, about questioning the way things are, about tech and business and how important it is to stay true to oneself amidst all the noise. The past 5 years have brought some of the toughest and brightest moments of my life, and without a doubt, the best part has been the people I’ve met along the way.

Happy pride,  
Luke
