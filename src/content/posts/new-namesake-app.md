**Over the past year, we've completely rebuilt the Namesake app.** We're launching this new version today and we hope it helps you!

## Why redesign?

- First app created 3 years ago
- Bubble sux
- MA-specific
- Regular downtime, difficult to update, no structure for expanding to other states
- Relies on proprietary code

## What's new?

### All-new design

### Clearer, more accessible forms

### Improved security

Emphasis on security: all responses end-to-end encrypted, all form-filling happens on your device

### We're open source

Open Source codebase [link to GitHub, link to Discord]

## What's next?

More states! More forms! More user feedback and contributions :)



### Sunsetting the old app

The existing app at [masstpc.joinnamesake.com](https://masstpc.joinnamesake.com/) will shut down on **August 31, 2025**, at which point, all existing user data will be deleted. There is no way to transfer data from the old site to the new one. If you have forms from the site you would like to download, please do so before August 31st.

### Supporting more states

Looking for region- and state-specific legal support and partnership. If you work for an org which facilitates name changes in the US, please reach out to us at [hey@namesake.fyi](mailto:hey@namesake.fyi).

### Ongoing development

There's so much more in store we're excited to share with you. All of your generous feedback, questions, and ideas have helped us better understand how we can improve Namesake amidst very limited funding and resources.

Respectful and accessible name changes are one part of a larger puzzle in creating a world where trans people—and all of us—can live life freely and joyously.

**[Join us on Discord](https://namesake.fyi/chat) to chat, get help, and get involved.** There are people here to support you. For those who've already been through the process, there are opportunities to help facilitate name change clinics, contribute code, and even help Namesake expand to additional states.
